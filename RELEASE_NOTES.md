# Release Notes - 2025.12.17

## UI Internal Improvements
- **About Me Section Layout**: Optimized the spacing above the "About Me" section. Restored the bouncing arrow icon but adjusted the section layout to maintain a balanced look.
- **Mobile Responsiveness**: Improved readability on mobile devices by adjusting typography sizing, table padding, and spacing in the "Security Team Plan" section.

## Content Updates
- **Security Team Plan Section**:
  - Updated the "Interface" terminology to "OKR" to better reflect the goal-oriented nature of the team structure.
  - Added detailed structure for "Security Squad", explicitly defining Units (Product & Platform, Cloud & Infra, GRC, Enablement & Trust).
  - Updated section headers from questions (e.g., "Why...") to assertive statements (e.g., "Security Team is Essential Power") to convey stronger confidence and clarity.
  - Added a Korean subtitle "(몰입할 수 있는 보안팀)" to the main "Security Team Plan" section title for better context.
